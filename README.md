# About

A live markdown renderer. Something I threw together for [Google Bootcamp Sarajevo][gbs].

The interesting thing about this is not really the code, so much as how little of it there is. If you ignore the line that sets up some demo content, it really boils down to one simple function and a couple of HTML attributes. No DOM selectors, no event handlers, no binding. [AngularJS][ang] makes this trivially easy.

[See it in action][live].
